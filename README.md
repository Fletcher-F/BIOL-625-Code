# BIOL 625 Code
## Fletcher Falk (230169031)
This repository functions as an appendix for all the code utilized throughout the class.

## Each folder contains the code used for each assignment:
-A1: Alignment comparisons. Raw data is quality checked and trimmed before alignment. Summary statistics of each alignment is generated and compared.

-A2: ANGSD files. Alignment BAM files are variant called and saved in various ANGSD formats for downstream analyses.

-A3: Population genomics. NGSadmix and NGSdist are ran within ANGSD. Resulting outputs will be visualized within R Studio.

-A4: Introgression. Within ANGSD, the ABBA-BABA (f statistic) test is ran to determine ancient hybridization and genomic introgression.

-A5: Genomic differentiation. Within ANGSD, site frequency spectra and FST statistics will be determined and visualized with a Manhattan plot.
